427.mp3,In simple words they say they lost their appeal . 
428.mp3,"For example , nursing students study in a nursing college for three-four years . "
429.mp3,"I believe , that the product 's quality mentioned in the shops are exactly the same as given in the adds . "

445.mp3,"becase if study in this way of cours , I will gante so much , I also will have alot of information the book I study . "
446.mp3,"When you understand the concepts and ideas is up to you to prove them , to see if they are really what you have been told , i think this is the main reason why students prefere facts rather than just understanding ideas and concepts . "
447.mp3,"for example , if you are attempting to study arts and scienses and to get equalifications in both , you are extraordinary creation . "
448.mp3,"Therefore , as long as it is a country where I can understand their language , I will travel alone . "

482.mp3,"In my opinion , I think advertisements are make products seem much better than they really are . "
483.mp3,"So , some people use car only by move somewher . "
484.mp3,They have to think twice before performing even routine activities of life . 
485.mp3,"Most of the actors , soldiers , workers and students are young people . "
486.mp3,To respond adequately to the world we live in we need to understand it first . 
487.mp3,Infact even today most of these systems runs on electricity which can be harnessed by several non polluting ways .

495.mp3,Buses should be reserved for spots where there is no possibility to set up tramway routes . 
496.mp3,I think that it is not always fair because not all the students work in the same way and with the same responsibility . 
497.mp3,"Of course , things are new and very risky . "
498.mp3,"For example , little children are told that do not cross the street at red light , because it is so dangerous that we cannot let kids learn from crash . "
499.mp3,in my opinion students need to a knowledge . 
500.mp3,So because more people are able to buy cars the demand for cars will increase and so the production of cars will also increase and in the end this means that the number of cars will increase from now to twenty years time . 
501.mp3,"First , they have spend many time on the computer , so they does n't know how to communicate . "

508.mp3,"Some people might say""hey how does energy come "" . "
509.mp3,the successful people try to do new things likr any machine can help the people . 
510.mp3,"However , the problem is how long will it take us to find out that we are actually controlled by the advertisements and the perfect image they gave us ? "
511.mp3,Comsumers are not likely to buy a pair of trousers when the claim is that they will increase capacity to fly .
